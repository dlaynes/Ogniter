The site worked well enough, but nowadays I'd use TimescaleDB for the database ranking records (because having 500+ tables is terrible), and a light modern MVC Framework based on PHP or any other language.

You can install the default countries with the following command:

`php artisan ogame:update-communities`

Please take a look at the other registered commands of the project

For more information about the website installation, please see this thread
